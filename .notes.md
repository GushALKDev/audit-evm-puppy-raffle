# High

- (R) Found a Reentrancy attack `PuppyRaffle::refund()`

- Found weak randomness at `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` (x2)
  - `uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % players.length;`
  - `uint256 rarity = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.difficulty))) % 100;`

- `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees()` is vulnerable to self-destructing contracts, if a self-contract send some ETH to this contract, it will be locked forever
  - `require(address(this).balance == uint256(totalFees), "PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");`
  - We should use the players array to check if there are players or not. `(require(players.length == 0, "PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");`

# Medium

- (R) Found a DoS atack in `PuppyRaffle::enterRaffle()`

- (R) Found integer overflow at `PuppyRaffle::totalFees`

# Low

- Protect from void players list on `PuppyRaffle::enterRaffle()`
  - require(newPlayers.length > 0, "PuppyRaffle: newPlayers array must not be empty");

- `PuppyRaffle::getActivePlayerIndex()` If the player is at index 0, it will return 0 and the player might think they are not active.


#  Informational

- `PuppyRaffle::entranceFee` is inmutable, and should be like `PuppyRaffle::i_entranceFee`

- `PuppyRaffle::players[]` is storage, and should be like `PuppyRaffle::s_entranceFee`

- `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner()` Recommended follow CEI pattern

- `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner()` `uint256 totalAmountCollected = players.length * entranceFee;`  It is better to use address(this).balance

- `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner()` - `prizePool` It is better to use totalAmountCollected - prizePool.

- Missing events in `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner()` and `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees()`

- `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees()` If there are players, we canÂ´t withdraw the fees (MEV).

- Function `PuppyRaffle::_isActivePlayer()` is not used.
