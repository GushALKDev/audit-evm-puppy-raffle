- Found a Reentrancy attack (PuppyRaffle::refund())

- Found weak randomness at `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner`

# Medium

- Found a DoS atack

- Found integer overflow at `PuppyRaffle::totalFees`

# Low

- `PuppyRaffle::getActivePlayerIndex()` If the player is at index 0, it will return 0 and the player might think they are not active.

#  Informational

`PuppyRaffle::entranceFee` is inmutable, and should be like `PuppyRaffle::i_entranceFee`

`PuppyRaffle::players[]` is storage, and should be like `PuppyRaffle::s_entranceFee`
